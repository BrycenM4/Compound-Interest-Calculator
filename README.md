All coding done in C++ using Visual Studio.

RECAP:

**What did you do particularly well?**
- I think I did well on organizing the code and making it easy to read/understand. Everything is seperated into different classes which makes it look clean and efficient.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
- My in-line comments could have been much more detailed overall, which would improve the code's readability.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
- The pointers were challenging for me at first since it was my first time ever using them, but after doing a lot of googling and youtube watching, I was able to at least get a basic grasp of how they work.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
- Like I mentioned earlier, I thought my organization was good, so that will obviously transfer to other projects. Other than that, I also got a lot of practice with formatting output, specifically with creating the charts that show up at the end of the program.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
- I utilized OOP principles to make the program maintanable, readable, and adaptable. For example, I split the program into multiple classes for encapsulation, and made the user input simple which improves it's abstraction quality. Overall, I just tried to make it easy to read and understand even for someone like me, who currently doesn't have a lot of c++ experience.
